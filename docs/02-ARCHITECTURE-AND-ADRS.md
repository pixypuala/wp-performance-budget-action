# Architecture and Required Decisions

## Architectural shape

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| packages/cli | Configuration, execution, comparison, output and exit codes. |
| packages/action | GitHub Action wrapper and summary annotations. |
| packages/collect-browser | Playwright/Chrome traces and lab metrics. |
| packages/collect-wordpress | Client for diagnostic companion data. |
| wordpress/diagnostic-plugin | Test-only Server-Timing/query/cache diagnostic hooks. |
| fixtures | Known regressions and baseline sites. |
| schema | Budget and result JSON Schemas. |

## Public interfaces

- Budget schema with metric unit, direction, threshold, tolerance, aggregation and required/optional status.
- Collector plugin interface with versioned metric names and provenance.
- Result envelope storing git SHA, environment, browser, WordPress/PHP versions, sample values and comparison.
- Exit codes distinguish regression, invalid config, unavailable metric, infrastructure error and internal error.

## Dependency direction

- Domain contracts and schemas must not depend on UI, CI vendor or a concrete adapter.
- WordPress integration depends on domain contracts; domain contracts must remain testable outside a full browser journey where practical.
- Reporters consume immutable results and cannot change test outcomes.
- Examples and fixtures depend on released/public packages; production packages never depend on examples.
- Generated files are reproducible outputs and include generator/version provenance.

## Required ADRs before implementation

1. **ADR-0001 – repository topology and package boundaries.** Monorepo vs split repositories, release units, ownership and dependency rules.
2. **ADR-0002 – minimum/support matrix.** WordPress, PHP, Node/Bun, WooCommerce/browser/runtime policy and scheduled next-version testing.
3. **ADR-0003 – public API and schema versioning.** Semantic versioning limits, deprecation period and compatibility classification.
4. **ADR-0004 – local/CI environment.** Container, wp-env, Playground or custom fixture strategy; database and browser lifecycle.
5. **ADR-0005 – data and migration policy.** Storage, idempotency, backup, rollback and irreversible changes.
6. **ADR-0006 – permissions and trust boundaries.** Capabilities, authentication, remote calls, filesystem/command execution and secrets.
7. **ADR-0007 – test pyramid and sampled matrix.** Which checks run per commit, pull request, scheduled build and release.
8. **ADR-0008 – observability and result schema.** Error taxonomy, logging, redaction, artifacts and retention.
9. **ADR-0009 – build/release provenance.** Lockfiles, generated artifacts, signing/attestation policy and tag workflow.
10. **ADR-0010 – licensing and contribution ownership.** Project license, third-party assets and contributor terms.

## Error model

Every operational error must include a stable code, category, human message, remediation, safe context and causal chain. Categories: configuration, unsupported environment, permission, validation, dependency, setup/migration, assertion/contract, timeout/cancellation, network, infrastructure, security policy and internal defect.

## Extension rules

- Extension points are named, typed/schematized, versioned and tested.
- Hooks/events do not expose mutable internal objects without a documented stability promise.
- Adapters declare capabilities and side effects; core never infers dangerous capability from method presence.
- Experimental interfaces are clearly namespaced and excluded from stability promises.
- Removal requires deprecation notice, migration guidance and the published support window.

## Architecture review gate

No implementation phase beyond the walking skeleton starts until ADR-0001 through ADR-0006 are accepted, the main trust boundaries are drawn, and one end-to-end vertical slice proves the proposed package direction.
