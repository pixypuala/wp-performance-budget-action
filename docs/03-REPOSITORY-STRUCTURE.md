## Root-file responsibilities

- `README.md`: product, quick start, bounded support statement, demo, limitations and links.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: environment, commands, branch/commit/PR rules, tests, generated files and review expectations.
- `SECURITY.md`: supported versions, private reporting route, response expectations and disclosure coordination.
- `SUPPORT.md`: supported questions, issue routing, response policy and what is not support.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: user-visible change history; generated commit dumps are not acceptable.
- `LICENSE`: approved open-source license after dependency/asset compatibility review.
- Lockfiles: one authoritative lockfile per ecosystem; never hand-edit.

## Naming and code rules

- One domain concept per file/class/module where practical.
- Names describe responsibility, not implementation accident (`ContractRunner`, not `Helper2`).
- Tests mirror source paths and name behavior/expected result.
- Fixtures are immutable inputs; generated runtime state belongs in ignored temporary directories.
- Never commit `.env`, credentials, production exports, user uploads, browser storage or vendor caches.
- Generated artifacts include a header or manifest naming the generator and source hash.

## Ownership

CODEOWNERS must cover security-sensitive code, public schemas, release workflows, migrations and dependency manifests. At least two maintainers review changes to release/security workflows after the project has more than one maintainer.
